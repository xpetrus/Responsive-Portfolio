            <p> My name is Peter, I am 22 years old. I live in New Jersey. I recently graduated from Rutgers Univeristy with a major in Information
                Technology and an minor in Public Health. 
            </p>
            <p> I have a great interest in technology and its profound impacts on human life and society. I desire to learn a great deal more about how to interact with
                new and interesting technologies as well as how they can be used to enhance everyday life.
